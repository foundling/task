## Task
A really simple command-line task manager


## Usage: 

```

task (prints out current tasks)

task -h, --help (prints this usage message)

task add <task1> <task2> <task3> ... (adds tasks one by one) 

task pop (removes top of stack)

task top (shows top of stack)


What a task is:
a <task> is a single word describing a task you want to get done.
Quote your input to express a multiple-word sequence
``` 


# To Do
+ improve config to allow at least the following:
  - precede a completed task with an 'x' instead of deleting it
